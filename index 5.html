    <p> The day we went to the pumpkin patch farm, I drove to your house and then you took us to the pumpkin patch farm. It waa the coolest pumpkin patch farm. They had all these cool rides and mazes, like a slide that tractor thing, and cute animals. We had to ride on a car truck thing ( train but not a train frrrr) And I remember when we started holding hands it gave me butterflies and made me nervous on the ride over and in the maze. We crushed the maze and then picked out a pumpkin. Then we got the best cookies ever and i tried root beer.
